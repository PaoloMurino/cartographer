# Changelog

### Migration note

**0.8.0 — semantic search and `index_rebuild` are removed.** The `search` MCP tool no longer accepts `mode` or `use_semantic`: a call passing either now fails with an error naming the removal, instead of silently returning keyword results it did not ask for. The `index_rebuild` MCP tool is gone — `reindex` covers it, with `full: true` for the whole rebuild (`cartographer reindex --full` from the CLI). The server's `--ollama` flag is removed too; a stale `search:` block in `config.yaml` and the `CARTOGRAPHER_OLLAMA`/`CARTOGRAPHER_OLLAMA_MODEL` variables are ignored rather than fatal, so an un-updated configuration does not take the server down. Search is FTS5 keyword search only, and an existing SQLite index keeps working: its embedding table is no longer created or read, and no reindex is required.

**0.7.0 — `cartographer kb create <name>` requires an explicit remote decision**: pass `--remote <url>` to attach an empty repository as the KB's `origin` and push the initial commit to it, or `--no-remote` to keep the previous behaviour and create a local-only KB. Without either flag the command exits 2. Scripted invocations must be updated; `--no-remote` restores exactly what they did before.

KB histories with commits authored as `cartographer <cartographer@localhost>` may need a manual author rewrite before a forge with author push rules accepts the first push.

## [0.10.0](https://github.com/BeppeTemp/cartographer/compare/v0.9.0...v0.10.0) (2026-09-06)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* clients must be upgraded before the server. The released v0.9.0 CLI stops working against this server for two independent reasons: the SDK's Streamable HTTP transport rejects a POST whose Accept header does not name both application/json and text/event-stream (the old client sends no Accept at all), and server/discover — which the client's control plane uses for status and sync — exists only in the 2026-07-28 era and answers -32601 to a handshake-era request. The new client against a v0.9.0 server was verified working, so upgrading clients first is safe; the reverse order is not. Also removed: the non-standard notifications/skills/list_changed. stdio is now a session and the server tears down on EOF, so `echo … | cartographer serve` races its own response; hold stdin open instead.

### Features

* serve MCP through the official Go SDK, after a full-repository audit ([#204](https://github.com/BeppeTemp/cartographer/issues/204)) ([bf9ce31](https://github.com/BeppeTemp/cartographer/commit/bf9ce317b6d2a3fcde15113dbef05452ebc872b4))
